          typically uses a strict SUBJECT VERB OBJECT (SVO) word order in simple
          sentences, as in Students (S) read (V) books (O). This SVO word order
          becomes altered in many other English sentence types. For example, in
          WH-questions in which the beginning WH-word represents an
          <span> OBJECT</span>, a sentence can reflect an
          <span> OVSV</span> word order:
          <span
            >What (O) have (V) the students (S) done (V)? In a sentence that
            begins with a VERB-ing form, a sentence can reflect a VOSVO word
            order: Finishing (V) the book (O), the student (S) completed (V) the
            assignment (O).</span
